# ferret-py
Simple cross-platform 3D model viewer

This python file parses and displays a 3D model, rotating it slowly on the screen. It uses the CPU, can be compiled using PyInstaller (~10MB) or Nuitka (~7MB). This code is deprecated, as a new version made in C++ is being created, so the source code is now available.
